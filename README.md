# VITALE_ENGINE
Hello VITALESOFT employees, this is the repository for the VITALE_ENGINE, which is what we will use to create our games.

# Compiling/Running
To get started running the engine, follow the "Getting Started" Guide in the Wiki.

# Distribution
There are very strict rules you follow as a VITALESOFT employee, and one of those rules is that UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY YOU DISTRIBUTE VITALE_ENGINE TO ANYONE OUTSIDE OF VITALESOFT. DOING SO WILL HAVE YOU FIRED, AND HAVE NO CHANCE OF COMING BACK.
