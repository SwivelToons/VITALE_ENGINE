Hello developers, this is the repository for the VITALE_ENGINE, which is what we will use to create games here at VITALESOFT.

# Compiling/Running

# Distribution
If you want to tell/let people know about this engine, be my guest. This engine is released under the MIT License. One thing I do ask of you, is to NOT take this engine, or the code of it, and claim it as your own.
